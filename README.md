# FindMovie

**A Flutter app for searching movies from a database.**  
This app includes a Search page for finding movies and a Favorites page for viewing and managing your favorite movies.
Itâ€™s my first project where I aimed to implement clean architecture with a feature-first design.

## Features

- **Search Page**: Search for movies by name from a movie database.
- **Favorites Page**: View all your favorite movies and manage them.

## Usage

1. Open the app.
2. Use the **Search Page** to search for movies by name.
3. On the **Favorites Page**, view all movies added to your favorites list.

## Showcase
